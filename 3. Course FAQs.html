<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">1. Do I need to use Jupyter Notebooks and Anaconda?</strong></p>

<p>No, <strong class="redactor-inline-converted">you can use whatever IDE you want</strong>! All the code we show in the course is compatible with any text editor or IDE that works with Python! You can even convert the notebooks to .py files by using nbconvert or just by clicking Save As -&gt; .py file.</p>





<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">2. Where do I get the notebooks for this course?</strong></p>





<p>You can get them as a zipped file resource in this lecture or you can also get them in the lecture titled "Jupyter Notebooks"</p>





<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">3. Is there a good companion book for the Machine Learning Section?</strong></p>





<p>Yep! <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">You can find it here.</a> I mention it again many times in the ML section.</p>





<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">4. I'm having technical issues with Video or Sound not showing up, who do I contact?</strong></p>





<p>Make sure to contact <strong class="redactor-inline-converted">support@udemy.com</strong> I don't control the technical platform, I just create the content! Again please direct all technical platform issue questions to<strong class="redactor-inline-converted"> support@udemy.com</strong></p>





<p><strong>5. How do get my certificate of completion?</strong></p>





<p>Please follow Udemy's instructions here: </p>https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229603868-Certificate-of-Completion<p><strong>6. Hey Jose, you talk a bit slow in the lectures, any way I can speed it up?</strong></p>



<p>Sure, you can click on the speed changer on the lower left hand part of the video player, up to 2x speed! Since we have many students how are non-native english speakers in the course, I try my best to talk a steady pace to help their understanding!<br></p>



<p><strong>7. How do you get the Docstring and method list pop-ups in Jupyter Notebook?</strong></p>



<p>Use Tab with your cursor directly after a defined variable to see the list of methods. For example, given: <strong>my_list = [1,2,3] </strong>you could then run that cell to define <strong>my_list</strong> as a variable, afterwards you could just type: <strong>my_list. </strong>(notice the dot) and then press Tab to see the list of methods. For the doctrings of functions, use Shift+Tab with your cursor right after the function.</p>



<p><strong>8. Do you provide personal or corporate training?</strong></p>



<p>Yes! Check out my profile for a link to my webpage at Pierian Data to get more info!<br></p>

<p><strong>9. How do I know where my Notebooks are being saved?</strong></p>



<p>To find out where your notebooks are type: <strong>pwd</strong> in a cell. This will print your working directory.</p>



<p><strong>10. How can I change where the Notebooks are being saved?</strong></p>



<p>You will need to change the directory in which you are starting you jupyter notebook. Use <strong>cd</strong> in the terminal or command prompt to change to your desired directory.</p>



<p><strong>11. How do I open .ipynb files? What program do I choose?</strong></p>



<p>In order to open the Notebook Files you'll need to have Python and the Jupyter Notebook system installed, check out the Python Set-up section for more details on the installation of Python and the Jupyter Notebook system (or you can just follow the relevant instructions <a href="http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> if you feel more technical). Once you have python and the jupyter notebooks installed you are ready to open the notebooks using the following steps:
</p>



<ol><li>First open up your Command Prompt (search for <strong>cmd</strong> on a Windows machine) or if you are on a Mac use your terminal (Spotlight search for <strong>terminal</strong>).</li><li>Next in you terminal/command prompt type <strong>pwd</strong> and press enter (this will print your working directory)</li><li>Take note of what file directory was displayed, this is where you should save your <strong>.ipynb</strong> files (or a folder containing your <strong>.ipynb</strong> files)</li><li>Once your <strong>ipynb </strong>files or folder containing the files is in the location displayed from the <strong>pwd</strong> step go back to your terminal and type <strong>jupyter notebook</strong> and press Enter.</li><li>After Step 4 you should have a browser tab open up with the Jupyter Notebook system running inside of it.</li><li>Click on your Notebook (or go to your folder of Notebooks) displayed in the Jupyter Notbeook and it will open in a new tab with the Notebook you selected.</li><li>You should now have successfully opened a Notebook file.</li></ol><p><strong>12.
